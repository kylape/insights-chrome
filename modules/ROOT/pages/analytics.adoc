=== Entitlements spread

The entitlements are passed to pendo as `entitlements_entitlementName` and
`entitlements_entitlementName_trial`. If the current user has the entitlement
or the trial entitlement, it will appear in the list.

=== Debugging

You can invoke `pendo.enableDebugging()` from the web console to see the
information passed to pendo to verify and debug if information is not showing
up as it should.

=== Pendo API

Applications are free to use the {pendo}[Pendo API] in order to have more
complex interactions with Pendo.
